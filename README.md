## Jupyter Notebook Viewer
* This is a utility which lets you preview jupyter notebooks faster on your Linux machine, with a double click.
* Requires no internet and is faster.
* Shows gibberish when the filename contains spaces, eg: `"hello world.ipynb"`, rename the file properly to ensure compatibility eg: `helloworld.ipynb`.  

# Installation
* Clone the repository

```markdown
git clone https://github.com/jithu7432/nb-viewer.git ; cd nb-viewer 
```

```

## Usage

 `properties` >> `open with`>>`Notebook Viewer`

* From the next time, view Jupyter notebooks with a double click!
